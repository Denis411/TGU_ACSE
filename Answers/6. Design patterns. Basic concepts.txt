Design patterns. Core concepts.

Design patterns are nothing more but standardized solutions to frequent problems.

Why use patterns?

- Saving time
Do not invent the wheel
- Communication purposes
You can replace a complex explanation of either a problem or a solution with a single work
- Readability
Many people know Dos which means your code is going to be more readable
- Maintainability
Using patterns helps you use SOLID principles
- Testability
Comes as a result of logic separation

A common mistake happens when unexperienced programmers begin using patterns without thinking, patterns can be altered with different solutions. DPs are meant for problem solving not for project development.

UML is a language for design that is often used in creating diagrams.
