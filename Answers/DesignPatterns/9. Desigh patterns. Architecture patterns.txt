Architecture patterns (AP)

Speaking of APs I must highlight the fact that every approach must be used in a specific situation. For example, there is no need to use a complex AP when creating a small pet project. Another highlight is that you can combine APs to make something new.

Here is a list of APs that I consistently use:
- MVC
- MVP
- VIPER
- MVC
- MVVM
- VIP

V is usually for view, M is used for Model.

The main idea of any architecture is to separate UI logic from business rules.
You can use principles of Clean Architecture with many approaches.

Examples implemented by me.
