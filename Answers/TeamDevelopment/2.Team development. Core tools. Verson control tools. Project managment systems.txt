Project management systems(PMS)

There is a countless number of PMSs in the modern world. However, I have to mention that some companies utilize very specific tools developed for themselves. In addition, you have to keep in mind that PMSs may be used by non-it companies too.


Three the most popular PMSs
- Jira
- Basecamp
- ClickUp

You should not be focusing on a specific tool even though all PMSs are pretty much the same, learning concepts is a way better approach.
