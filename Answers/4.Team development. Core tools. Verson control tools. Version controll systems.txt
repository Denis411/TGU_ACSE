Version control systems(VCS)

There are three fundamental types of VCSs in the industry. I will describe all three types below.

Distributed VCS. (DVCS)
This is the most widespread type. The idea behind the type is as follows, a person copies a repository to his local machine. After making changes to the copy you have to merge changes with the main remote repo, doing so may lead to merge conflicts.
Git is a well-known implementation of a DVCS.


Centralized VCS. (CVCS)
This is an outdated type, which is rarely used nowadays. The idea behind the type is as follows, a person must pull the lates changes from a remote repo to create a commit after that the person can push changes.

Local Version Control System. (LVCS)
The older type. LVCS located on your local computer, in which every file change is stored as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version. Rarely do programmers use this approach.


Note.
Some huge companies use their own VCS combining all types of VCSs.
